### 2. Identify a suitable development methodology for each of the following case-studies. Identify one characteristic of the chosen methodology and explain how this characteristic benefits the project
1. As a consultant, I am involved in a project where the enterprise CEO has said to me: We have a moderate understanding of our requirements, yet we would like to see what the product looks like after some of the features of the product have been implemented. We donâ€™t need detailed documentation, yet we would like to see visual model of the business process and your proposed architecture.
   - incremental & iterative process (phases)
     - deliver features through iterations
   - AGILE
   - MVP - Minimum viable product
   - 
2. A manufacturing industry, that relies on the timely completion of dependent stages
   - Waterfall
     - Plan-driven
     - Sequential process
     - Minimises risk
     - Documentation heavier
     - Requirements well known
